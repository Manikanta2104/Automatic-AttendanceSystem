# REAL-TIME FACE RECOGNITION AUTOMATIC STUDENTS 
ATTENDANCE MANAGEMENT

There is no need, in the age of rapidly developing modern technologies, for an important educational event like attendance to be handled in a staid old-fashioned manner.
The class teachers and all of the pupils will benefit greatly from the time and effort that the attendance monitoring system will save. The face recognition algorithm
will keep track of attendance by isolating the faces of a person and recognizing them as attended. The model will be trained with photographs of all the students and
using this trained information, the algorithm will recognize everybody who attended by matching their features to the previously saved pictures of them if there are
attended in the database.
